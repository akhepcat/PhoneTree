# PhoneTree

This is a project to allow for emergency phone contact trees to
be manually or (eventually) automated during interesting events, such as
business outage drills, public safety exercises, emergency comms, family
checkins, etc.

# STATUS: planning stages

A simple database scheme has been written out for postgres and sqlite,
though how long the latter remains is a question for sure.

# TODO:

Lots!  

* finalize development language
* proof-of-concept code
* web UI
* email-to-SMS gateway
* admin interface
* scalability
* two-factor support

# HELPING

Clone the repo, work on some code, and send a PR!

# TIMELINE

..yeah, it's a spare-time, idle-thought project, so no timeline.

If I was really crazy, I'd try to finish it before Mt. Spurr erupts in
Alaska in 2025(ish) but we'll see!
